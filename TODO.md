        - Seems trivial but it's not:
            - Solution can be constructed with combinations of `#.`, `#:`, `p.` and `while.`.
        - Possible work around the need of three inputs:
            - Make it an adverb? which value `u`?
            - Make it a conjunction? `u` and `v` are the bases.
            - Boxed input containing the bases as left argument?
            - Boxed input containing the digits and base as right argument?
