# Installing J

J is highly protable and thus available accross a wide variety of
operating systems including Windows, macOS, GNU/Linux, Android,
Raspberry Pi, and ioS. The core `J Engine` is a shared library that
interprets `J` programs. There are a number of `J front ends`
including the terminal based `jconsole`, a browser based ide `JHS`,
and a `Qt`-based ide.

Addons and upgrades can be done using J's pckage manger `pacman`.

Please refer to [System/Installation](https://code.jsoftware.com/wiki/System/Installation) for instructions on how to get
things set up on your system.
